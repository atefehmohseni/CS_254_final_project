\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem}
In tiled many-core processors design processing cores are fitted onto a single chip and cores are interconnected via mesh-based networks. There are local and remote memory controllers for any tile (processing core) that are fitted onto the same chip \cite{tiled-manycore}. When a core wants to load or store to a memory address, it needs to map the cache line address to find the corresponding tile that it's sharing status is stored. In this report we will explore different mapping algorithms to efficiently map memory addresses to the caches given we have different tile sizes.
