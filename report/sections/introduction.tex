In tiled many-core processor design, cores are fitted onto a single chip and
interconnected via mesh-based networks. There are local and remote memory
controllers for any tile (processing core) that are fitted onto the same chip
\cite{tiled-manycore}. When a core wants to load or store to a memory address,
it maps cache line address to find the corresponding tile where its sharing
status is stored. In this report we will explore different algorithms to
efficiently map memory addresses to the caches given we have different tile
sizes.

We explored two main approaches to solving this problem, program synthesis and
parameterized hashing.  The first approach is based on a technique used widely
in the field of programming language theory.  In program synthesis, we state a
problem based on a specification of its constraints and allow a domain specific
engine or logical solver to explore the problem space for satisfying solutions.
In parametrized hashing, we investigate how to make existing hash functions
sensitive to various parameters describing the bins or output of the function.
We ultimately decide on a scheme based on voting theory. Finally, we canvas
alternate places where we might find solutions to this problem, specifically in
the field of machine learning.
