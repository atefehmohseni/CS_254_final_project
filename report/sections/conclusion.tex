\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this study we worked on hardware hash functions to efficiently map memory
addressees to caches of different sizes. We tried two approaches: program
synthesis and parameterized hashing. In the first approach, we tried to sketch a
hash function that applies different operators to different parts of a memory
address. In the second approach we simulated a hash function as a voting scheme
that maps addresses to cache lines based on bin sizes. The experimental results
of both approaches were successful but there is still room for improvement. In
future work it would be interesting to combine both approaches or even explore
machine learning based hash functions.
