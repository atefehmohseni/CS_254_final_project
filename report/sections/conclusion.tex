\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this study we worked on hardware hash functions to efficiently map memory addressees to caches given we have different tile sizes. We have tried two approaches: program synthesis and parameterized hashing. In the first approach, we tried to sketch a hash function to apply different operators on different parts of a memory address and returns what gives us the most accuracy meaning passed the most test cases. In the second approach we simulated a hash function as a voting scheme that map addresses to cache lines based on bin sizes. Although the experiments results of both approach were successful but still there is room for improvement. As the future work we can mix both approaches and check the result or make machine learning based hash functions like "learned indexes" \cite{learning-index} efficient for the hardware level.
